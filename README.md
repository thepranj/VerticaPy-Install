# VerticaPy-Install
Welcome to VerticaPy! This installation guide contains everything you need to get started.
*  **VerticaPy Installation Instructions**: a detailed, start-to-finish walkthrough on how to install VerticaPy and Jupyter and a guided tour of some of their functionality.
*  **VerticaPy Example.ipynb**: a companion for **VerticaPy Installation Instructions** (Jupyter required).
*  **`churn-workflow.py`**: a Python script that goes through the full data science cycle with an example dataset. Running the script will create a machine learning model for predicting how Telco customers might behave. For an extended, detailed walkthrough on the thinking behind this example, see the [VerticaPy documentation](https://www.vertica.com/python/examples/telco_churn/).
*  **`churn.csv`**: the example dataset used in **`churn-workflow.py`**. For more details on this dataset, see [Kaggle](https://www.vertica.com/python/examples/telco_churn/).
